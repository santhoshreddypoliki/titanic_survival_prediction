Tranining dataset :
The Training set should be used to build our machine learning models. For the training set, we use the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger.
Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

Testing dataset :
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger.


I had used various scikit learn models, preprocessing and standerdization techniques to get the best possible accuracy.

label encoding and Stadardization preprocessing techniques. 

I had also used GridSearchCV to find the best possible model for our dataset with best suitable parameters.
